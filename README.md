During the calculation of the indicator, the RSI values and Bollinger Bands are calculated for each bar. The RSI_Buffer is filled with the RSI values using the iRSI function. The UpperBB_Buffer and LowerBB_Buffer are filled with the upper and lower Bollinger Band values using the iBands function.

## Market Trends and Overbought/Oversold Conditions

After calculating the RSI and Bollinger Bands, the code determines the market trends and overbought/oversold conditions for each bar. If the RSI value is above 70, it is considered an overbought condition. If the RSI value is below 30, it is considered an oversold condition. If the RSI value is above the upper Bollinger Band value, it is considered an uptrend. If the RSI value is below the lower Bollinger Band value, it is considered a downtrend. If none of these conditions are met, there is no trend.
